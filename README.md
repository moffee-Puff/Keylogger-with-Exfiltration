# Keylogger-with-Exfiltration
A Python-based keylogger with exfiltration designed for ethical cybersecurity research. 
 This tool logs keystrokes in a controlled environment and exfiltrates data for analysis, helping researchers understand attack vectors and improve defensive strategies.


⚠️ Disclaimer:
This tool is for educational and research purposes only. Unauthorized use on systems without explicit consent is illegal. Always comply with local laws and ethical guidelines.



# How It Works
The Keylogger with Exfiltration captures keystrokes and sends logged data to a remote server via multiple exfiltration methods (HTTP, SMTP, FTP). It is designed to simulate real-world attack techniques for penetration testing and blue team training.

Key Features
1) Keystroke Logging
  Captures keyboard input (including special keys).
  Logs timestamps for behavioral analysis.
2) Multiple Exfiltration Methods
  HTTP POST (Sends logs to a remote server).
  SMTP Email (Emails logs to a researcher).
  FTP Upload (Uploads logs to an FTP server).
3) Stealth & Persistence (Optional)
  Can be configured to run in the background.
  Supports basic evasion techniques (e.g., log encryption).
4) Research-Oriented Reporting
   Generates structured logs for analysis.
   Helps in understanding malware behavior and defense mechanisms.

# How to Use

# Prerequisites
*Kali Linux (or any Linux distro with Python 3).
*Python 3.x.
*Required libraries: pynput, requests, smtplib, ftplib.

# Installation
Install Python Dependencies:
bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install pynput requests
Clone the Repository:

* bash*
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keylogger-research.git
cd keylogger-research
Configure Exfiltration Method:
Edit keylogger.py and set your preferred exfiltration method (HTTP, SMTP, or FTP).

Usage
Run the keylogger (for research purposes only):

bash
sudo python3 keylogger.py
The tool will start logging keystrokes.

Logs will be exfiltrated based on the configured method.

Example Workflow
bash
$ sudo python3 keylogger.py
[*] Keylogger started in research mode.
[+] Logging keystrokes to: keylog.txt
[!] Exfiltrating via HTTP to: http://your-server.com/logs
[*] Press CTRL+C to stop and generate report.
Ethical Use Cases
Penetration Testing (Red Team Exercises).

Malware Research (Analyzing keylogger behavior).

Defensive Training (Blue Team Detection Practice).

# Detection & Prevention
To help defenders, include a section on how to detect and mitigate keyloggers:
 # Detection:
   Monitor unusual processes (ps aux | grep python).
   Check network traffic for exfiltration attempts.
  # Prevention:
   Use anti-keylogging software.
   Restrict unnecessary Python execution in sensitive environments.
